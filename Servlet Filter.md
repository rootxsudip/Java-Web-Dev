In Java web development, a filter is a component of the Servlet API that allows us to perform preprocessing and postprocessing of requests and responses. Filters are used to intercept and manipulate both the request to a servlet and the response from it.
Filters are not tied to a specific servlet or JSP page, making them a versatile tool for performing tasks such as authentication, logging, data transformation, input validation, and more.

#### How it will work?
Servlet filter can intercept http request and process it before it can reach our specific servlet. The filter can also perform actions on servlet's response before it can reach the client side.

#### Why needed it?
* Suppose we need to do some server side validation on user's http request body for that we need to write code on every servlet but using servlet filter we just need to make one filter servlet.
* After that if we mentioned the servlet filter before the url pattern's in web.xml it will perform validation of those url pattern's servlet.

#### Filter: The javax.servlet.Filter interface in the Java Servlet API defines several methods that we can implement in our custom filter classes to perform various tasks during the request and response lifecycle. 
Here are the methods defined in the Filter interface:
* init(FilterConfig filterConfig): This method is called by the container when the filter is first created. It's typically used for filter initialization tasks.
  * The FilterConfig object contains configuration information specified in the deployment descriptor (web.xml).
* doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain):
  * This is the most important method in the Filter interface. It's called for each request that matches the filter's URL pattern.
  * It allows us to intercept and modify both the request and response. We can perform preprocessing before the request reaches the servlet and postprocessing after the servlet's response.
  * The FilterChain parameter is used to continue the request/response chain, allowing the request to move on to the next filter or servlet in the chain.
  * We mostly override this method after implementing filter interface in our class.
* destroy():
  * This method is called by the container when the filter is being taken out of service.
  * It's typically used for cleanup tasks, such as releasing resources or closing connections.

 #### doFilter method:
The doFilter method is the most critical part of a filter, as it's where we place the logic for processing requests and responses. Here's a breakdown of the doFilter method:
* The doFilter method takes three parameters:
        ServletRequest request: Represents the client's request.
        ServletResponse response: Represents the response that will be sent to the client.
        FilterChain chain: Allows you to pass the request to the next filter in the chain or to the servlet.
* Within the doFilter method, you can perform any preprocessing logic before calling chain.doFilter(request, response). After that call, the request is passed to the next filter or servlet.
* After the request has been processed by the servlet and returned a response, you can perform postprocessing logic.
* We can manipulate the request and response objects as needed, for example, by modifying headers, reading or modifying request parameters, and more.
* It's important to call chain.doFilter(request, response) to allow the request/response to proceed to the next filter in the chain. Failing to do so would prevent the request from reaching its intended destination.
* If necessary, we can perform actions after the chain.doFilter call. This is often used for postprocessing, such as logging or modifying the response before it's sent to the client.

#### A simple example of how to create and use a filter in a Java web application:
Create a Java class that implements the javax.servlet.Filter interface. The interface requires us to implement the doFilter method, which is where the filter's logic is defined.  
LogginFilter.java
```
import javax.servlet.*;
import java.io.IOException;

public class LoggingFilter implements Filter {
    public void init(FilterConfig filterConfig) throws ServletException {
        // Initialization code goes here
    }

    public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)
            throws IOException, ServletException {
        // Preprocessing logic before the request reaches the servlet
        System.out.println("LoggingFilter: Request received");

        // Pass the request to the next filter in the chain or the servlet
        chain.doFilter(request, response);

        // Postprocessing logic after the servlet has processed the request
        System.out.println("LoggingFilter: Response sent");
    }

    public void destroy() {
        // Cleanup code goes here
    }
}

```
Configure the Filter:  
To use the filter, we need to configure it in the web.xml file. Add the following lines to the web.xml file:  
web.xml
```
<filter>
    <filter-name>LoggingFilter</filter-name>
    <filter-class>LoggingFilter</filter-class>
</filter>
<filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>LoggingFilter</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/<our_pattern></url-pattern> <!-- Specify URL patterns to apply the filter -->
</filter-mapping>

```
