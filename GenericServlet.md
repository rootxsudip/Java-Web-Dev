In Java, the GenericServlet class is a part of the javax.servlet package. Generic Servlet implements 5 methods and so developers can create their own servlets by extending this class and overriding its methods, such as service(), init(), and destroy(), to provide custom functionality.
#### Keypoints:
* Generic servlets are protocol-agnostic, meaning they can handle requests and responses for various network protocols, not just HTTP. However, in practice, they are often used for handling HTTP requests.
* Limited functionality: Generic servlets provide a basic framework for servlet development but don't include built-in support for handling HTTP-specific features like request parameters, session management, or response headers. Developers typically use additional classes such as HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse to work with HTTP-specific features.
* Flexibility: Generic servlets are highly flexible and can be adapted to serve different purposes within a web application. Developers can implement custom logic within the servlet to handle specific tasks, such as processing form submissions, interacting with databases, or performing authentication.
* Deployment in a Java EE Container: Generic servlets are typically deployed and run within a Java EE (Enterprise Edition) servlet container, such as Apache Tomcat, Jetty, or WildFly. These containers handle the management and execution of servlets.

Ex: Simple Code of Generic Servlet
```
import javax.servlet.GenericServlet;
import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import javax.servlet.ServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.ServletResponse;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.PrintWriter;

public class MyGenericServlet extends GenericServlet {
    @Override
    public void service(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response)
            throws ServletException, IOException {
        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
        out.println("Hello from MyGenericServlet!");
        out.close();
    }
}

```
