A Spring container is at the core of the Spring Framework and plays a central role in managing Spring beans (objects). It is responsible for creating, configuring, and managing the lifecycle of these beans. The container essentially acts as a runtime environment for the Spring application.

#### There are two types of Spring containers:

* BeanFactory: This is the basic type of container provided by the Spring Framework. It is responsible for managing the beans defined in the Spring configuration file(s). It initializes beans lazily, meaning a bean is created only when it is requested. The BeanFactory is suitable for most applications where memory consumption is a concern and resources are limited.

* ApplicationContext: This is an advanced container that extends the functionality of the BeanFactory. ApplicationContext loads all beans eagerly when the container starts up. It provides additional features such as event propagation, internationalization support, and integration with AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming). ApplicationContext is generally preferred over BeanFactory for most applications because of its richer feature set.

#### The Spring container performs the following key functions:

Instantiation: It creates instances of beans based on the configuration provided in the Spring configuration file(s) or through annotations.

Dependency Injection (DI): It injects dependencies into beans, either through constructor injection, setter injection, or field injection. Dependencies are typically defined in the Spring configuration file(s) or using annotations.

Lifecycle Management: It manages the lifecycle of beans, including initialization and destruction. Beans can implement initialization and destruction callbacks to perform specific actions during these phases.

Configuration Management: It manages the configuration of beans, allowing developers to define bean properties, dependencies, and other settings in a centralized and declarative manner.

AOP Integration: It integrates with Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) to provide features such as declarative transaction management, logging, and security.

Overall, the Spring container provides a lightweight and flexible mechanism for building and managing enterprise Java applications, promoting loose coupling, modular design, and ease of testing.

#### Comparison of Bean Factory and ApplicationContext:

* BeanFactory:

Lazy Initialization: BeanFactory initializes beans lazily, meaning a bean is created only when it is requested. This can be beneficial for memory-constrained environments or applications with a large number of beans where you want to defer bean creation until necessary.

Lightweight: BeanFactory is lightweight compared to ApplicationContext because it initializes beans on demand, which can reduce memory consumption, especially in resource-constrained environments.

Basic Features: It provides basic features for managing beans, such as instantiation, dependency injection, and lifecycle management.

Suitable for Basic Applications: BeanFactory is suitable for simpler applications or scenarios where advanced features provided by ApplicationContext are not required.

* ApplicationContext:

Eager Initialization: ApplicationContext initializes all beans eagerly when the container starts up. This can lead to faster startup times as all beans are created upfront.

Rich Feature Set: ApplicationContext extends the functionality of BeanFactory by providing additional features such as event propagation, internationalization support, resource loading, and integration with AOP. It offers a more comprehensive set of features for enterprise applications.

Integration: ApplicationContext seamlessly integrates with various enterprise technologies and frameworks, making it well-suited for complex enterprise applications.

Preferable for Most Applications: ApplicationContext is preferred for most applications due to its richer feature set and ease of use. It offers benefits such as easier integration, better performance in certain scenarios, and comprehensive support for enterprise features.

#### Which one to use?
Most enterprise advanced web applications use spring application context for making rest api's and microservices.
