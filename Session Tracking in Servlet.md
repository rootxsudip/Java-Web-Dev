Session tracking in servlets refers to the process of maintaining state and tracking user interactions across multiple HTTP requests. This is essential for building interactive web applications that require user-specific data to be preserved between requests. Servlets use various techniques for session tracking, which allow you to maintain user sessions and store user-specific information.

The primary goal of session tracking is to associate a set of related requests and responses with a specific user during their visit to a web application. Here are some common techniques used for session tracking in servlets:
1. Cookies:
    * Cookies are small pieces of data stored on the client's device and sent back with each subsequent HTTP request. In servlets, cookies can be used to store a session identifier, which links the user to their session data on the server.
    * A session identifier (typically a random or unique value) is created and associated with a user's session. This identifier is sent to the client as a cookie.
    * Subsequent requests from the client include this cookie, allowing the server to identify and associate the request with the correct session data.
2. URL Rewriting:  
    * In URL rewriting, the session identifier is appended to every URL or link in a web page.
    * This identifier is used by the server to recognize and associate requests with the appropriate session data.
    * For example, a URL might look like: http://example.com/myservlet?sessionid=abcdef12345.
3. Hidden Form Fields:
    * Hidden form fields can be included in HTML forms. These fields store the session identifier and are submitted with form data when the user interacts with the application.
    * Servlets can extract the session identifier from form submissions and use it to maintain user sessions.
4. HTTP Session Object:
    * The HttpSession object provided by the servlet container allows servlets to maintain session state. It is created when a user first visits the application and persists until the session expires.
    * You can use the HttpSession object to store and retrieve session-specific data on the server.
    * The session identifier is typically stored as a cookie or in the URL, but the servlet container manages this transparently for you.
5. Custom Session Tracking:
    *  Developers can implement custom session tracking mechanisms. This might involve using other HTTP headers or client-side storage mechanisms like Local Storage or Session Storage in combination with AJAX requests.
    *  Custom session tracking may be necessary in situations where the standard techniques are insufficient or when additional security measures are required.

Session tracking is crucial for maintaining user state, such as user authentication, shopping cart contents, and user preferences, as users navigate through different pages and interact with the web application. Servlet containers provide built-in support for session tracking, and you can choose the method that best fits your application's requirements and constraints.
