In Java web applications, the web.xml file is an important configuration file that is used to define the structure and behavior of the web application. It is part of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) specification and is used primarily with technologies like Servlets and JSP (JavaServer Pages) to configure and customize the behavior of the web application.

#### Overview
**XML Format:** The web.xml file is an XML (eXtensible Markup Language) file, which means it uses a structured, tag-based format for configuration.  
**Location:** The web.xml file is typically located in the WEB-INF directory of a Java web application. The WEB-INF directory is not directly accessible via a web browser, making it a secure place to store configuration files and resources.  
**Deployment Descriptor:** The web.xml file is often referred to as the "deployment descriptor" because it provides configuration information to the web container (such as Tomcat, Jetty, or others) regarding the structure and behavior of the web application.  
**Common Configurations:** Common configurations defined in the web.xml file include:  
  * Servlet Definitions: You define servlets in the web.xml file, mapping them to specific URL patterns. This mapping tells the web container which servlet should handle requests for particular URLs.
  * Filter Definitions: Filters are used to intercept and process requests and responses. You can configure filters in the web.xml file, specifying the URL patterns they should filter.
  * Listener Definitions: You can define application event listeners in web.xml to listen for specific events in the application's lifecycle, such as application startup or session creation.
  * Error Page Definitions: You can specify error pages in the web.xml to handle different types of errors, such as 404 (not found) or 500 (internal server error).
  * Welcome Files: You can specify default "welcome" files that should be displayed when a user accesses a directory without specifying a specific resource.
  * Context Parameters: You can define context parameters that are accessible throughout the application. These parameters are often used to store configuration settings.

Example of web.xml:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<web-app>
    <servlet>
        <servlet-name>Hello</servlet-name>
        <servlet-class>Hello</servlet-class>
    </servlet>

    <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>Hello</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>/Hello</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>

    <welcome-file-list>
        <welcome-file>index.html</welcome-file>
        <welcome-file>index.xtml</welcome-file>
        <welcome-file>index.htm</welcome-file>
        <welcome-file>index.jsp</welcome-file>
    </welcome-file-list>

</web-app>
```
