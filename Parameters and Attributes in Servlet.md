In the context of servlets in a Java web application, "parameters" and "attributes" refer to different types of data that can be associated with a request, a session, or a servlet context. These terms are often used interchangeably but have distinct meanings and usage.  

Parameters:  
* Request Parameters: These are typically supplied by the client (e.g., a web browser) as part of an HTTP request. They are included in the URL query string or in the body of a POST request. Request parameters are used to pass data from the client to the server. In a servlet, you can access request parameters using the HttpServletRequest object.  
Example of request parameters in a URL:
```
http://example.com/servlet?param1=value1&param2=value2
```
* Initialization Parameters: These are specified in the web.xml deployment descriptor for a servlet. They are used to configure and initialize the servlet when it is first loaded. Initialization parameters are accessible via the ServletConfig object and are typically used for configuration settings.  
Example of defining an initialization parameter in web.xml:
```
<servlet>
    <servlet-name>MyServlet</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>com.example.MyServlet</servlet-class>
    <init-param>
        <param-name>databaseURL</param-name>
        <param-value>jdbc:mysql://localhost/mydb</param-value>
    </init-param>
</servlet>

```
* Form Parameters: These are parameters submitted through HTML forms. In a servlet, you can access form parameters using the HttpServletRequest object when handling form submissions. Form parameters are typically sent in POST requests.
Example of an HTML form with input fields:
```
<form action="MyServlet" method="post">
    <input type="text" name="username">
    <input type="password" name="password">
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

Attributes:  
* Request Attributes: These are objects that can be set as attributes on the HttpServletRequest object. Request attributes are used to pass data between components in a request-response cycle. They have request scope, meaning they are only available within the scope of a single request. You can set and retrieve request attributes within a single request cycle.
```
// Setting a request attribute
request.setAttribute("message", "Welcome to the servlet!");

// Retrieving a request attribute
String message = (String) request.getAttribute("message");

```
* Session Attributes: These are objects that can be set as attributes on the HttpSession object. Session attributes are used to store data that is associated with a particular client's session and can be accessed across multiple requests as long as the session is active.
```
// Setting a session attribute
HttpSession session = request.getSession();
session.setAttribute("user", "John");

// Retrieving a session attribute
String user = (String) session.getAttribute("user");

```
* ServletContext Attributes: These are objects that can be set as attributes on the ServletContext object. ServletContext attributes are application-wide and can be accessed by all servlets within the same web application. They are typically used for sharing data and resources across different parts of the application.
```
// Setting a servlet context attribute
ServletContext context = getServletContext();
context.setAttribute("appConfig", someObject);

// Retrieving a servlet context attribute
Object config = context.getAttribute("appConfig");

```
In summary, parameters are data supplied to the servlet, often from client requests or configuration settings, while attributes are objects associated with requests, sessions, or the application context, used for data sharing and storage within the servlet or across multiple servlets in a web application.
