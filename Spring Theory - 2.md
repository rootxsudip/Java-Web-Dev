1. POJO (Plain Old Java Object):  
* A POJO is a simple Java object that does not depend on any special frameworks or libraries.
* It typically follows JavaBeans conventions (having private fields, public getter and setter methods, and a no-argument constructor), but it does not implement any interfaces or require any base classes.
* POJOs are commonly used in various contexts in Java development, such as data transfer objects, domain objects, and model objects.
* All java objects are pojo.

2. JavaBean:  
* A JavaBean is a specific kind of POJO that adheres to certain conventions.
* It typically has private fields that are accessed through getter and setter methods.
* JavaBeans must provide a default (no-argument) constructor and should implement Serializable if they are intended to be serialized.
* JavaBeans are commonly used for encapsulating data in GUI frameworks like Swing, where properties of objects can be bound to components.

3. Spring Bean:  
* A Spring bean is a Java object that is managed by the Spring Framework's Inversion of Control (IoC) container.
* In the context of Spring, any POJO can be a Spring bean if it is declared in the Spring configuration and managed by the Spring container.
* Spring beans are typically configured in XML files, Java configuration classes, or using annotations like @Component, @Service, @Repository, etc.
* Spring beans can have additional features provided by Spring, such as dependency injection, AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming), declarative transaction management, etc.
* While Spring beans can adhere to JavaBean conventions, they are not required to do so; Spring does not mandate specific getter/setter naming conventions or the presence of a default constructor.
